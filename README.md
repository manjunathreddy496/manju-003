#I USE VSCODE FOR RUN THE OPERATIONS
I've created a comprehensive real-time collaborative editor that meets all your requirements
Development Tools
ESLint - Code linting and quality assurance
Concurrently - Run multiple commands simultaneously
Nodemon - Auto-restart server during development
TypeScript Compiler - Type checking and compilation
UI/UX Libraries
Lucide React - Beautiful icon library
React Router DOM - Client-side routing (ready for expansion)
# Project Description
What is this project?
A real-time collaborative editor similar to Google Docs but specifically designed for coding and note-taking. Multiple users can simultaneously edit the same document with instant synchronization, cursor tracking, and user presence indicators.

Core Functionality
# Real-time Collaboration
Live Text Synchronization: Changes appear instantly across all connected users
Cursor Tracking: See where other users are typing with colored cursors and name labels
User Presence: Real-time list of active collaborators with unique colors
Conflict Resolution: Seamless handling of simultaneous edits without data loss
# Advanced Code Editor
Monaco Editor Integration: Full-featured code editor (same as VS Code)
Multi-language Support: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, JSON, Markdown, SQL, XML
Syntax Highlighting: Language-specific color coding and formatting
Code Intelligence: Auto-completion, error detection, and code folding
Theme Support: Professional light theme with customizable options
# Multi-user Features
Anonymous Access: No registration required - jump right in
Unique User Identity: Auto-generated names and colors for each user
Document Sharing: Shareable links for easy collaboration
Session Persistence: Maintain connection across page refreshes
# Professional Features
Document Management: Create new documents or join existing ones
File Export: Download documents in appropriate formats (.js, .py, .java, etc.)
Language Switching: Change programming language on-the-fly
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
Clean UI: Modern, intuitive interface with smooth animations
Architecture Overview
Client-Server Communication

Client (React) ←→ WebSocket (Socket.IO) ←→ Server (Node.js)
Real-time Data Flow
User joins document → Server creates/joins room
User types → Changes broadcast to all room members
Cursor moves → Position shared with other users
Language changes → Updated across all collaborators
User disconnects → Others notified, cursors removed
Data Management
In-memory Storage: Documents stored on server (easily extensible to database)
Room-based Architecture: Each document is a separate Socket.IO room
State Synchronization: Consistent state across all connected clients
# Key Benefits
For Developers
Pair Programming: Code together in real-time
Code Reviews: Collaborative code examination
Teaching: Instructor can guide students live
Team Projects: Multiple developers on same codebase
For Teams
Meeting Notes: Collaborative note-taking during meetings
Documentation: Team-authored technical documentation
Brainstorming: Real-time idea sharing and development
Knowledge Sharing: Instant collaboration without setup
Technical Advantages
Type Safety: Full TypeScript implementation
